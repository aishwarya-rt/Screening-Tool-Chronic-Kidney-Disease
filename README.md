# Screening-Tool-Chronic-Kidney-Disease
Built a model using logistic regression that predicts CKD. Selected and validated significant factors by using R (PCA and Random Forest), and by consulting with physicians.  Designed an easy-to-use survey by capturing the above factors and used correlation to provide a risk score that predicts likelihood of getting CKD.
